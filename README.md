## 7. Test Command

You can sync model changes by changing **force: false** to true. This will also remove all data and start fresh.
Once you have synced, stop the applicatio by using ctrl + c on your keyboard and change the force:true to false and restart the application.

Once the above is done, you can now use Insomnia to do the routes commands.

@ server.js line 14

// sync sequelize models to the database, then turn on the server
sequelize.sync({ force: false }).then(() => {
  app.listen(PORT, () => console.log('Now listening'));
});
